* Part 1: Exploratory Data analysis (EDA): 

** I explored the data and performed the necessary cleaning. 

* Part 2: Training Algorithms and then evaluate the models on the validation set; best performance model was evaluated on the test set

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling
